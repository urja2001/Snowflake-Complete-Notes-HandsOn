Column-level Security in Snowflake allows the application of a masking policy to a column within a table or view. 

To protect sensitive data like customers PHI, bank balance info etc.

Column-level Security includes two features:

               Dynamic Data Masking
               External Tokenization

Dynamic Data Masking is a Column-level Security feature that uses masking policies to selectively mask plain-text data in table and view columns at query time.

Tokenization is the process of hiding sensitive data by replacing it with an cipher text.

External Tokenization makes use of masking policies with external functions created at external cloud provider side.


Masking Policies

Snowflake supports masking policies to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access while allowing authorized users to access sensitive data at query runtime.

Masking policies are schema-level objects.

Masking policies can include conditions and functions to transform the data at query runtime when those conditions are met.
